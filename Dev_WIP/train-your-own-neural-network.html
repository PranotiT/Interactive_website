    <h1>Train Your Own Neural Network</h1>
    <p>
      This is a hands-on project where you can train your own
      <a href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/neural-network">Neural Network</a> starting from a blank state, to get a brief
      insight into the steps involved. In the previous project on opacity, we
      looked at classification. Here we will look at an example of regression.
      Regression is where the output is on a scale or a dial.

      You can control the movement of a circle with your body. You will go
      through the following main steps: (1) Collecting training data, (2)
      training the model, and (3) prediction or making an inference. The slider
      can be used to move the circle from left to right. Our aim is to replace
      the slider and control the movement using our own body. For this project,
      the movement is retricted from the left to the right. In the steps below,
      I mention moving your hand left to right, but you can use any other part
      of your body such as legs, head movement, etc. You can also use another
      object in your hand, as long as it is a progressive motion.

          The model will be trained in a few seconds and you can control the
          ball with your hand movements.

      <li>
        Collecting training data: Training data is a data set representative of
        the data the machine learning model is provided with to solve the
        problem it’s designed to solve. The training data needs to be properly
        prepared—randomized, de-duped, and checked for imbalances or biases that
        could impact the training.
      </li>
      <li>
        Training the model: Choosing an algorithm and training the it to create
        the model. Training is an iterative process with adjusting multiple
        settings until the algorithm returns the correct result most of the
        time.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prediction or making an inference: Using the model with new data and, in
        the best case, for it to improve in accuracy and effectiveness over
        time. Where the new data comes from will depend on the problem being
        solved.
