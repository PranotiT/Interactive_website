  <h1>Exploring Neural Networks</h1>
  <p>Your life is already affected by <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/machine-learning">Machine learning</a> -
    whether you are aware of it or not. It is used in the USA to make important decisions such as screening resumes of
    job applicants, to suggesting how long a criminal should be incarcerated. It is also used in shopping websites to
    suggest which product you should buy next or which advertisement you should see. To develop your own opinion on how
    it should be used to impact your life, you need to know more about what they are, how they work, and when it is
    actually useful to use them.</p>

  <p>Machine learning is not about teaching computers how to think like humans. It is about applying math to large
    quantities of information. Machine learning provides computer systems the ability to automatically learn and improve
    from experience without being explicitly programmed. The process of learning begins with observations or data, in
    order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.
    The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust
    actions accordingly. A neural network is a type of machine learning which models itself after the human brain.</p>

  <p>A peek behind the curtains to see how machine learning works to enable us to start having a discussion about its
    various aspects impacting life. I believe that machine learning has the potential to change the world for the
    better. But to understand how it can, it is important to know and be aware of its pitfalls. I look to explain key
    aspects of machine learning to anyone without prior knowledge, so as to start a conversation. A few key aspects to
    be aware of: opacity, scale and damage. Some of which can be countered with: transparency, controlled by the user,
    and personal.</p>

  <h3>Interactive Demonstrations</h3>

      <h4><a href="./uncovering-opacity">Uncovering Opacity</a></h4>
      <p>Real-world applications use pre-trained models to make decisions that impact our lives. There is often opacity
        behind what data is used to train the model. In this project, I use a pre-trained model to show how they are
        limited by the data they are trained on. </p>

      <h4><a href="./train-your-own-neural-network">Train Your Own Neural Network</a></h4>
      <p>This is a hands-on project where you can train your own neural network to get a brief insight into the steps
        involved. You can control the movement of a circle with your body. You will be (1) Collecting training data, (2)
        training the model, and (3) prediction or making an inference.</p>

  <h3>Further Learning</h3>
  <p>If you have already gone through the above two demos and are more interested in the topic, you can check the
    following resources to get you started.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>An artist or musician’s perspective can be found in this course taught by Rebecca Fiebrink on <a
        href="https://www.kadenze.com/courses/machine-learning-for-musicians-and-artists-v/info">Kadenze</a>.</li>
    <li>Math behind Machine Learning can be learnt about in this course taught by Andrew Ng, Stanford University on <a
        href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Coursera</a>.</li>
    <li>Some people who’s work inspired me are:
      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/You-Look-Like-Thing-Love/dp/0316525243">Janelle Shane</a>,
      <a href="https://www.amazon.de/Weapons-Math-Destruction-Increases-Inequality/dp/0553418815">Cathy O’Neil</a>, and

      K. Cukier</a>.</li>
    <li>Some simple experiments to start exploring machine learning, through pictures, drawings, language, music, and
      others can be found at <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/ai">Experiments with Google</a>. You 
      can often try them in the website itself without having to download any other software.</li>
