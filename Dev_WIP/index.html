  <h1>This is Your Thesis Title</h1>
  <p>A peek behind the curtains to see how Machine Learning works and start a discussion about its various aspects
    impacting life. I believe that machine learning has the potential to change the world for the better. But to
    understand how it can, it is important to know and be aware of its pitfalls. I look to explain key aspects of
    Machine Learning to anyone without prior knowledge, so as to start a conversation. A few key aspects to be aware of:
    opacity, scale and damage. Some of which can be countered with: transparency, controlled by the user, and personal.
  </p>
  <p>Machine Learning is not about teaching computers how to think like humans. It is about applying math to large
    quantities of information. Machine learning provides computer systems the ability to automatically learn and improve
    from experience without being explicitly programmed. The process of learning begins with observations or data, in
    order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.
    The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust
    actions accordingly.</p>

        Pre-trained models are used in real-world applications to make decisions about various aspects of our lives. I
        also use pre-trained models in this project to show how they are limited by the data they are trained on. Yet,
        they are used to influence important aspects of our lives. Pre-trained model has learnt based on a fixed
        dataset. If i show it an image not from it’s dataset, it will not know about it. </p>
