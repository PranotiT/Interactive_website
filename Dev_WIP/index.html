  <h1>Exploring Neural Networks</h1>
  <p><a href="">Machine Learning</a> is not about teaching computers how to think like humans. It is about applying math to large
    quantities of information. Machine learning provides computer systems the ability to automatically learn and improve
    from experience without being explicitly programmed. The process of learning begins with observations or data, in
    order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.
    The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust
    actions accordingly.</p>

  <p>A peek behind the curtains to see how Machine Learning works and start a discussion about its various aspects
    impacting life. I believe that machine learning has the potential to change the world for the better. But to
    understand how it can, it is important to know and be aware of its pitfalls. I look to explain key aspects of
    Machine Learning to anyone without prior knowledge, so as to start a conversation. A few key aspects to be aware of:
    opacity, scale and damage. Some of which can be countered with: transparency, controlled by the user, and personal.

      <h4><a href="./undercovering-opacity">Undercovering Opacity</a></h4>
      <p>
        Real-world applications use pre-trained models to make decisions that impact our lives. There is often opacity
        behind what data is used to train the model. In this project, I use a pre-trained model to show how they are
        limited by the data they are trained on. </p>

      <h4><a href="./train-your-own-neural-network">Train Your Neural Network</a></h4>
      <p>This is a hands-on project where you can train your own neural network to get a brief insight into the steps
        involved. You can control the movement of a circle with your body. You will be (1) Collecting training data, (2)
        training the model, and (3) prediction or making an inference.</p>
