  <h1>Uncovering Opacity</h1>
  <p>A machine learning model is a mathematical representation of a real-world process. Here, we use a model which is
    already trained to recognise images - a pre-trained model.<a href="">Pre-trained models</a>  are used in real-world applications to
    make decisions about various aspects of our lives. I also use pre-trained models in this project to show how they
    are limited by the data they are trained on. Yet, they are used to influence important aspects of our lives.
    Pre-trained model has learnt based on a fixed dataset. If i show it an image not from it’s dataset, it will not know
    about it. </p>
  <p>This hands-on demonstration focuses on the usage of “pre-trained models” in Machine Learning using image
    classification. In <a href="">classification</a>, information is categorized into predefined categories. For example, an email can
    either be ‘spam’ or ‘not spam’. You can hold up an object to the webcam and the model will recognise the object.
    Sometimes, the recognition is not accurate. Below, you can search through the list of images this model is trained
    on, to see if the object they are showing is a part of it.</p>

  <h3>Images It Is Trained on</h3>
  <div id="search-box">
    <input oninput="updateResult(this.value)" type="search" placeholder="Type to start searching..." />
    <div class=result-box>
      <ol class="list-group result"></ol>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>How The Objects Are Recognized</h3>
  <p>
    This is a classification problem. The pre-trained <a href="">MobileNet</a> model has a fixed number of things it
    knows about - the
    images it is trained on. The list of images is below and you can search through them. It will classify the object
    you are showing it based on the original 1,000 image categories it is trained on. It is not aware of any other
    information. Which is why, you will find that oftentimes, the items shown through the webcam are not classified
    accurately - such as your face! But the result you see will be something from the original 1,000 categories composed
    of nearly 15 million images from the <a href="">ImageNet</a> database.
