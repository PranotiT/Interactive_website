  <h1>Train Your Own Neural Network</h1>
  <p>
    This is a hands-on project where you can train your own
    <a href="https://deepai.org/machine-learning-glossary-and-terms/neural-network">Neural Network</a> starting from a
    blank state, to get a brief insight into the steps involved. In the previous project on opacity, we looked at
    classification. Here we will look at an example of regression. Regression is where the output is on a scale or a
    dial. For example, instead of giving an output that someone is “happy” or “sad” (which is classification),
    regression gives an output of how happy or sad someone is.
  </p>
  <p>In the demonstration below, you can control the movement of a circle with your body. You will go through the
    following main steps: (1) Collecting training data, (2) training the model, and (3) prediction or making an
    inference. The slider can be used to move the circle from left to right. Our aim is to replace the slider and
    control the movement using our own body. For this project, the movement is restricted from the left to the right. In
    the steps below, I mention moving your hand left to right, but you can use any other part of your body such as legs,
    head movement, etc. You can also use another object in your hand, as long as it is a progressive motion. </p>

  <h3>You Trained It Using 3 Main Steps</h3>

  <ol class="styled-numbering">
    <li>
      Collecting training data: Training data is a data set representative of
      the data the machine learning model is provided with to solve the
      problem it’s designed to solve. The training data needs to be properly
      prepared—randomized, de-duped, and checked for imbalances or biases that
      could impact the training.
    </li>
    <li>
      Training the model: Choosing an algorithm and training it to create the model. Training is an iterative process
      with adjusting multiple settings until the algorithm returns the correct result most of the time.
    </li>
    <li>
      Prediction or making an inference: Using the model with new data and, in
      the best case, for it to improve in accuracy and effectiveness over
      time. Where the new data comes from will depend on the problem being
      solved.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Real-World Applications</h3>
  <p>We have often encountered regression problems where machine learning is used - such as in forecasting or
    predictions. Weather forecasting often uses this method. Based on data, weather is predicted. It does not just say
    that the weather will be hot or cold, but rather how hot or how cold and give the temperature value on a scale. For
    a human to crunch through the vast amount of data and predict the weather for every location on the planet, everyday
    would be nearly impossible. This is a situation where machine learning is useful to use.</p>
